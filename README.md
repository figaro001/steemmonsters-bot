# steemmonsters-bot
This is a bot, took everything what you need in order to make a better one :)


## Instructions
Change the "White Rules" for the splinter that you want to use. Just enter your monsters id into it according to the manacap.
Install the files and type "node server.js" into the terminal.

This Bot wouldn't be here without the @smitop help, his work allows me to understand the process :D
